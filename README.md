# Better-Layer-Arranger-for-PS
Those scripts for photoshop allow you to select one layer and then place in front or behind another selected layer.

HOW TO USE
1) Select the layer you want and execute "Layer to Move.jsx" script
2) Now select the layer you want to use as reference for placing the first layer to move
3) Chose between "Place behind.jsx" or "Place in front.jsx".

TIPS
1) If you need to rearrange the first layer again, you are required to execute all HOW TO USE steps from the begining.
2) It was only tested on Photoshop Version CC2018

KNOWN PROBLEMS
1) It doesn't work if Photoshop file has groups in it

FUTURE UPDATES
1) Make the scripts work if there is Groups in it
2) Make some panel or contextual menu for better usability

I'm actually graphic designer and illustrator so I don't know exactly when or if I will do these implemantations. It worked fine for me as it is.

WHY

When you have a ton of layers and the Photosghop native options (Bring to front, Bring forward, Send backward, Send to back) are not enough and I haven't found any plugin or script on the web I developed it myself.
This is the piece of art which I used this scripts first: http://leoaysketches.tumblr.com/post/167649037329/
